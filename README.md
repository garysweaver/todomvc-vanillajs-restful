TodoMVC Javascript Client for RESTful Services
=====

An example of TodoMVC client that uses RESTful services such as todomvc-services-javaee6.

Based on [VanillaJS][todomvcvanilla] (plain Javascript) [TodoMVC][todomvc] implementation, but using JQuery for some of the Ajax for now.

Is just HTML, Javascript, and CSS but packaged as war for now so could be easily deployed to same JBoss server as todomvc-services-javaee6 until have time to test out with a CORS implementation.

Has been tested in JBoss 7.1.1.Final in OS X 10.7.4.

### Setup

Please see the todomvc-services-javaee6 project and do that setup, build, and deploy. Then come here and do the build and deploy.

### Build

    mvn clean install

### Deploy

If you cloned the todomvc-services-javaee6 and this project into the same dir, and put jboss into the other project's directory, you'd do this. Otherwise, just change the path:

    cp target/todomvc-vanillajs-restful.war ../todomvc-services-javaee6/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/standalone/deployments/

### Testing

http://localhost:8080/todomvc-vanillajs-restful/

### Issues

Currently marking all and deleting all doesn't work yet.
